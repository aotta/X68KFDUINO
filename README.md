# X68KFDUINO
External floppy disk adapter for Sharp X68000, based on Arduino Nano

Use 2 buttons to give X68k the insert/eject signals: you have to eject the virtual floppy (turn off green led) when led flashes, select the image on HxC/Gotek, then re-insert the virtual floppy (Green led re-turned on).
This for disk 1 or 2, as needed.
